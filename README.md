# Book-Management-System
The Book Management System is a simple backend application built with Golang and the Gin framework. It allows users to manage books, register and authenticate, and borrow/return books securely. The system follows RESTful API principles and includes security best practices like password hashing (bcrypt) and JWT-based authentication.
